# Installation

Install via npm

	npm install vandium --save

# Getting Started

Vandium creates event specific handlers to reduce the amount of code than one
needs to maintain. The following handler code will response with a message when
executed using the AWS API Gateway with a `GET` request:

```js
const vandium = require( 'vandium' );

// handler for an api gateway event
exports.handler = vandium.api()
		.GET( (event) => {

			// return greeting
			return 'Hello ' + event.pathParmeters.name + '!';
		});
```

The framework can process asynchronous responses using promises. The following
code returns a User object from a datastore asynchronously:

```js
const vandium = require( 'vandium' );

// our datastore access object
const Users = require( './users' );

// handler for an api gateway event
exports.handler = vandium.api()
		.GET( (event) => {

			// returns a promise that resolves the User by name
			return Users.getUser( event.pathParmeters.name );
		});
```

Additionally, resources can be closed at the end, success or failure, of the
handler. Failure to close resources might cause the lambda function to timeout
or run for longer than is required. The following code demonstrates closing a
cache after the handler has been called:

```js
const vandium = require( 'vandium' );

// our datastore access object
const Users = require( './users' );

// object caching - automatically connects on first access
const cache = require( './cache' );

// handler for an api gateway event
exports.handler = vandium.api()
		.GET( (event) => {

			// returns a promise that resolves the User by name
			return Users.getUser( event.pathParmeters.name );
		})
		.finally( () => {

			// returns a promise that closes the cache connection
			return cache.close();
		});
```

# Event Types

Vandium targets specific event types to allow validation and targeting of specific event specific data. The following event types are
supported by the framework:

- [api](apigateway.md)
- [cloudformation](cloudformation.md)
- [cloudwatch](cloudwatch.md)
- [cognito](cognito.md)
- [dynamodb](dynamodb.md)
- [generic](generic.md)
- [kinesis](kinesis.md)
- [lex](lex.md)
- [s3](s3.md)
- [scheduled](scheduled.md)
- [ses](ses.md)
- [sns](sns.md)

**Note:** The `generic` handler for custom or generic handling of any of the event types if further control or customization is required.


# Initializing before event handler is called

Vandium provides the opportunity for initialization code to be executed on each invocation of your handler. The `before()` method is used to
define code that gets called before the handler to do things like open a database connection or connect with a cache instance.

The following example demonstrates how you can use the `before()` method to open a cache before the handler is called:

```js
const vandium = require( 'vandium' );

const User = require( './user' );

const cache = require( './cache' );

exports.handler = vandium.api()
        .before( (context) => {

            return cache.connect();
        })
        .GET( (event, context) => {

                // handle get request
                return User.get( event.pathParmeters.name );
            })
        .POST( {

                // validate
                body: {

                    name: vandium.types.string().min(4).max(200).required()
                }
            },
            (event) => {

                // handle POST request
                return User.create( event.body.name );
            });
```

The code inside the `before()` method can be:
* Synchronous
* Asynchronous (in the form of `(context, callback)=> {}`)
* Promise

And any result returned will be stored in `context.additional` and can be accessed in the handler and `finally()` methods.

**Note:** If an exception is thrown in the `before()` method, then the `finally()` method will not be called.

# Cleaning up after event handlers

You can clean up and free resources using the `finally()` method on all event handlers. The `finally()` method is executed after each
execution of the handler if your code has been executed. If an exception is raised within the `finally()` function, it will get logged and
execution will continue.

The following example shows how you can use the `finally()` method to free a cache connection after each execution using the `api` event
type:

```js
const vandium = require( 'vandium' );

const User = require( './user' );

const cache = require( './cache' );

exports.handler = vandium.api()
        .before( (context) => {

            return cache.connect();
        })
        .GET( (event) => {

                // handle get request
                return User.get( event.pathParmeters.name );
            })
        .POST( {

                // validate
                body: {

                    name: vandium.types.string().min(4).max(200).required()
                }
            },
            (event) => {

                // handle POST request
                return User.create( event.body.name );
            })
        .finally( () => {

            // close the cache if open - gets executed on every call
            return cache.close();
        });
```

**Note:** If an exception is thrown during the validation and verification, such as JWT processing, phase prior to your code
execution, then the code inside `finally()` will not get called.

# Configuration via `vandium.json`

If you would like to specify configuration using a configuration file, you can place a `vandium.json` file at the root of your project. The
file is a standard JSON file with the following structure:

```js
{
    "jwt": {

        "algorithm": "<algorithm-type>",
        "publicKey": "<public key>",        // if using RS256
        "secret": "<secret value>",         // if using HS256, HS384 or HS512
        "token": "<token path inside event>",
        "xsrf": "true | false",
        "xsrfToken": "<xsrf token path inside element>",
        "xsrfClaim": "<xsrf claim path inside jwt element>"
    },
    "prevent": {

        "eval": "true | false"              // prevents the use of eval()
    }
}
```

# Automatic Loading of Environment Variables from SSM Parameter Store

Vandium can automatically load environment variable values from the [AWS SSM Parameter Store](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-paramstore.html). The environment variables are
loaded synchronously and thus will be set before any other code is loaded. To provide the SSM path where the environment variables
are located, set the `VANDIUM_PARAM_STORE_PATH` environment variable at deployment time. We recommend using a path-based approach to
storing environment variables using the following convention:

    /<group name>/<stage>/env

where the `<group name>` might be the name of the service or function name, and the `<stage>` would represent "production", "test", etc.

The format is user defined by the path and all values underneath the path will be loaded from SSM.

**Note:*** Please ensure that your Lambda function has the correct permissions to access the SSM Parameter Store including access to
custom KMS keys (if used to encrypt secrets).

# Support for Node 4.3.2
If you require support for the previous version of Node.js (4.x) then use Vandium 3.x

# Compatibility Issues with Vandium 3 Projects

Vandium 4's event handler mechanism allows targeted handling of event specific scenarios and thus code written using Vandium 3.x will
**not** be compatible with this version. To migrate your Vandium 3 code, use a targeted event handler or the
[`generic`](docs/events/generic.md) event.
